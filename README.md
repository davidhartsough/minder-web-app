## **Twice Daily Reminders**: _for what's worth remembering_

### How it works:

Simply make a list of things you want to be reminded of, and **minder** will send you **two random reminders** each day, randomly scheduled **between 9am-8pm**.

Once the list is complete, it starts fresh with a new random sequence.

The unpredictable order and timing keeps your reminders engaging.

**For example**, if someone makes a tiny list like this:

- Hydrate
- Stretch
- Smile
- Take a deep breath

Their notifications might start to look like this:

- **Day 1:** "Take a deep breath" (at 10am), "Hydrate" (at 3pm)
- **Day 2:** "Smile" (at 12pm), "Stretch" (at 7pm)
- **Day 3:** "Hydrate" (at 9am), "Smile" (at 2pm)

And so on â€” always shuffling, always refreshing.

### What it's for:

Some people use this tool to build healthy habits, instill personal values, and practice skills.

You decide what goes on your list.

So what's worth remembering?

What will you keep in mind? What will you keep fresh?
